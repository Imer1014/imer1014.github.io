My Github account was created a while back but have never used it.
The repository I created is attached to the username Imer1014 and I cloned the one from the internet to the desktop Github. When I opened the github desktop, there was an option that said "Clone Repository from internet" and I clicked on that option then clicked on the imer1014.github.io option.
